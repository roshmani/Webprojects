<!--/*Make a page that has on it an element that is 200px by 200px in size and has a
 solid background color. Nest within that element another element that is 50px by
  50px in size and has a different solid background color. When the user clicks on
   the outer element its background color should change to a randomly selected color.
    However, if the user clicks on the inner element, the inner element's background
    color should change to a randomly selected background color but the outer element's
    background color should not change at all.*/-->
